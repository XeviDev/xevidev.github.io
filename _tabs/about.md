## Bald, Geek, Heavy Metal enjoyer and Developer <img src="/assets/img/Hi.gif" width="30px"/>!!!

Hello! My name is Jose Vicente, aka XeviDev, and I come from a village near Alicante, Spain . I love everything that has to do with technology and I enjoy programming. I like programming anything, but I especially enjoy mobile programming in Kotlin.

I have created this blog to share my notes and my experiences in the world of programming. All constructive feedback is welcome!

Follow me to see how I grow professionally and improve my English little by little!
